# soloLife

soloLife is an offline gamified task management application. Users can create multiple collections, manage tasks within each collection, and contribute to a main progress level. The app uses a game-like system where completing tasks earns points to level up. Users can spend points in a shop to unlock cosmetic items such as profile image frames, customize cover images, switch between light/dark themes, and unlock achievements.
